KProject Concept:
Some data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery.
Jane is a Data Scientist and Samit is a Statistician.

We will need to decide who is going to do what in this project.
We might need someone with programming skills.
They need to be competent in R and python, matplotlib and ggplot.
